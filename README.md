> **Stop AWS bill surprises before they ship.**
>
> Most infrastructure changes look harmless until next month's AWS bill lands. [CloudBurn](https://cloudburn.io) analyzes the cost impact of your AWS CDK changes right in the GitHub pull request, so expensive mistakes get caught during code review, while a fix is still a one-line change.

> 1. **Install the free [CDK Diff PR Commenter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aws-cdk-diff-pr-commenter)** in the repository where you build your AWS CDK infrastructure
> 2. **Then install the [CloudBurn GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/cloudburn-io)** on the same repository
>
> From then on, every PR with infrastructure changes gets a comment with your CDK diff analysis, and CloudBurn adds a cost report next to it:
> - **Monthly cost impact**: whether this change raises or lowers your AWS bill, and by how much
> - **Per-resource breakdown**: which resources drive the change, old versus new monthly cost
> - **Region-aware pricing**: rates match the region your infrastructure actually deploys to
>
> Cost review happens inside code review, so you optimize as you code, while the context is still fresh.
>
> CloudBurn is free during beta. After launch, a free Community plan (1 repository, unlimited users) stays available.

## Features

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Offers snippets for **all** AWS IAM actions available across various AWS services.
2. **Auto-completion**: Provides intelligent auto-completion for IAM actions as you type.
3. **Documentation Links**: Quick access to AWS documentation for each IAM action directly from the snippet.
4. **Flexible Format Support**: Supports IAM policies in JSON, but also IAM Policies defined in CloudFormation templates (`.json, .yaml`), and Terraform files (`.tf`).
5. **Up-to-Date**: Regularly updated to reflect the latest AWS IAM actions.
6. **Smart Hover Information**: When hovering over wildcard actions, displays all matching IAM actions, providing a comprehensive view of the permissions covered.

## Usage

1. Install the AWS IAM Actions Snippets extension in VS Code.
2. Open or create a new `.json`, `.yml`, or `.tf` file for your IAM policy.
3. Start typing an IAM action name (e.g., `s3:Get`) in the appropriate place in your policy.
4. The extension will provide auto-completion suggestions for matching IAM actions.
5. Select the desired action to insert it into your policy.

Example of auto-completion in action:
